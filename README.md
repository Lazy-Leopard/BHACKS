# Swasthyam 
A flutter based healthcare care trying to create a twin system for the present Hospital Based Medical System over a city, created during B-Hacks.


## Idea motivation and solution
The architecture of our healthcare ecosystem is divided into three layers:-
1. Patient going to doctor with symptoms and doctor recommending tests
2. Patient coming back with test results and doctor conforming disease
3. Doctor starting treatment

Our application will solve the first two layers and make healthcare system more fast and efficient.
We have done:-
1.) predicting disease from symptoms in our app
2.) recommending test for those diseases in app
3.) Developing AI based deep learning Algorithm for giving probability of having that disease
4.) integrating that DL algo in our app with Flask API framework
